title: On supporting diversity in tech
---

As a male in tech, what should I do to support female participation in tech?
 
First of all, you do what you’ve already done—you ask. This is a very important step that often gets skipped over in the name of action. Uninformed action is usually more harmful than no action at all. So every time you enter a new environment, group, conference, workplace, anything, the first step should be to ask how you can help.
 
The next step is, predictably, listen to the answer. So far this may sound simplistic or condescending, but I promise I am sincere. It’s very easy for people to assume good intentions are enough to effect positive change, but they really are not. If you have never been in the position of the people that you are attempting to support, you have to educate yourself about what that position is like. The best way to do this is to listen to them about their experiences and opinions, and adjust your actions according to their needs.
 
Really, the best thing you can do is listen. Follow more women, and others from populations marginalized in tech, because everything is interconnected, on Twitter. Read their blogs. Attend their talks. Encourage their selection for more talks. Promote their work to others. If they ask for it, volunteer to help their classes and workshops. Back them up in conversations and in workplaces.
 
The difficult and sometimes frustrating thing about change is that lasting, meaningful change generally grows from the bottom up through a consistency of small, positive actions. There is no silver bullet or sweeping, top-down initiative that can fix everything. Large-scale initiatives can sometimes help, of course. But, for individuals, change is in the details of education, habit and mindset, stuck to and applied to every moment of every day.
 
Stick with it. You’re off to a good start.
