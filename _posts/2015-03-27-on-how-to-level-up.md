title: On how to level up
---

Once you've got your "hello world"s, control flow and basic syntax under your belt, how do you progress as a coder? I'm currently at a bootcamp that's coming to its end and have stated numerous "intermediate" coding books, but I still feel like an advanced beginner. How do I level up?
 
Let’s start off with some possibly discouraging but necessary honesty: I have never been anything but an advanced beginner. I’m somewhat skeptical that the majority of us ever progress beyond that, or, frankly, need to progress beyond that. I say that not to demoralize, but to make the point that a linear journey from beginner to expert is not always a realistic or desirable one.
 
Rather, I choose to focus on the products. If you are an engineer, you build things. So build things. In order to keep myself learning, I find new problems to solve, new projects to work on, new things to build. I personally don’t learn through reading books or performing exercises. I learn through identifying something I want to create, and then figuring out how to do that. Keep going after bigger and more complicated creations, and you will necessarily learn stronger and more nuanced skills in order to make them realities.
 
This is also something you can do easily on your own. I started learning how to make things for the web fifteen years ago because I wanted to make my own website. Since then, my personal website has always been a constant source of opportunity to experiment. I think about what aspects of my life I want to make easier, then I make apps to make it that way. You can also level up by solving other peoples’ problems. Find a local nonprofit organization that needs technical help. Locate an open source project that wants new contributors. Seek out jobs, full-time or freelance, that challenge you.
