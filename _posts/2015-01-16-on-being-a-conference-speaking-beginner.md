title:  On being a conference speaking beginner
---

I found a conference that I would love to talk at. As a new developer in the field though, would it be wise to have someone nominate me rather than submit myself? I have a talk in mind and would love to practice my public speaking skills. However, should I even consider it if I'm just shy of year of development skills under my belt?
 
Yes, you should speak and, yes, you should nominate yourself to do so. Let me elaborate.
 
First of all, you don’t need to be an expert to speak at a tech conference. Experts, frankly, are bullshit. Don’t trust them, don’t be them. Learn what you do well, but beware of joining the ranks of the Expert. The overwhelming majority of the Experts I know are driven to be experts by anxiety, insecurity and a never-ending quest for external approval. The last thing we should be doing as a community is only letting these type of people speak and telling everyone else to stay quiet.
 
So, you don’t have to be at a certain level of experience or expertise to speak. What you do have to be is honest, enthusiastic and focused. Find the thing that you want to talk about, and put it in your own context. Tell your own story around it. Think about what you have that only you have, and bring that to your talk. If you do that, it doesn’t matter if your content is not advanced—you will have created something unique to you, and the audience will respond to your sincerity.
 
As someone relatively new to the industry, you have a special perspective to offer. Many people who have been working in tech for years often don’t even realize that fresh eyes on old problems is an irreplaceable benefit to have. They also forget some of the inherent joy of doing what they do on a daily basis. You have the power to remind them of that. There are others potentially out there who need your message as well. There may be audience members in the same place as you. There may be those even newer than you, who can appreciate the example of someone so close to their own perspective. There may be those who are just considering getting into development, and you could inspire them to do it. Believe it or not, you could have a wide range of influence.
 
On the practical details of getting started speaking: never wait for anyone to nominate you. Always nominate yourself. Submit proposals to all the conferences you want to, email meetup organizers to ask if you can speak, put the word out among friends and social media followers that you’re looking for speaking opportunities. What’s the worst that could happen? Someone says no? No problem. There are a ton of conferences and meetups and opportunities. Try another one. You’ll find the right fit eventually. It will probably take a lot less time then you imagine.
 
Speaking is a wonderful chance to share your genuine interest in what you’ve learned with others who want to learn about it, too. If you keep that as your priority and purpose, I promise that you will find people who want to hear what you have to say.
