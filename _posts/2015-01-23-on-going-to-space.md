title:  On going to space
---

If you had the opportunity to go to space, but it meant that you might not ever get to come back to Earth, would you go?
 
I’m going to assume this is not hypothetical, just to make it more fun.
 
So, to you, potential astronaut in a super-secret space program that is flinging humans beyond the reach of Earth, I say: this is a complicated question.
 
On one hand, I’m a true believer in the beauty of and need for space exploration. I mean, I’ve watched Star Trek since I was thirteen. I’m a fan of expanding human knowledge and experience. I think far more of our current resources should be devoted to scientific pursuits in general and space exploration in particular. There’s a lot out there to understand, and understanding even that lends a vital perspective on what’s happening back on our little rock.
 
Also, space is really fucking cool. There’s no way I could say I wouldn’t be interested in leading the charge in laying down extraterrestrial roots or sacrificing an earthly future for the sake of adventure.
 
However—I, personally, would not actually go. Not at this point in history, when the act of going demands so much dedication and preparation and uncertainty. I’m not ready to leave Earth behind. I’ve already dedicated myself to pursuits here, and I’m not done with them. As much as I love nature and enjoy being solitary with it, I also love observing and recording people, history and civilization, and there’s so much more of that to explore. Most importantly, I’m not yet done exploring myself.
 
When I was younger, and watching Star Trek, I assumed all adventures had to take place on an epic scale in order to qualify you as an adventurer. It took me a while to figure out that adventures are just throwing yourself into anything new and letting it change you. When defined as a choice between going somewhere objectively dangerous and staying somewhere else not dangerous, the choice between adventure and safety is a false dichotomy. Going to space would be an adventure. But so would any myriad of other things we have access to every day. In the end, it’s not about what you do, it’s just about how you do it.
 
If you go, though, send me pictures.
